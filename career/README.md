</strong></summary>

  ### 1. Include Your Full Name
  Incorporate your first and last name to personalize the file. This ensures recruiters can easily identify the document.

  **Example:**  
  `Vijay_Raghuwanshi`

  ### 2. Specify Your Role or Title
  Add the role or title relevant to your experience or the job youâ€™re applying for. This makes your resume appear tailored and relevant.

  **Example:**  
  `Vijay_Raghuwanshi_SDE`

  ### 3. Include "Resume" or "CV"
  Specify the document type for clarity, especially if recruiters deal with multiple file types.

  **Example:**  
  `Vijay_Raghuwanshi_SDE_Resume`

  ### 4. Save as PDF
  Use the PDF format to preserve the formatting and ensure compatibility with most devices and software.

  **Final Example:**  
  `Vijay_Raghuwanshi_SDE_Resume.pdf`

  ### Additional Tips:
  - **Avoid Spaces:** Use underscores (`_`) or hyphens (`-`) instead of spaces for compatibility with applicant tracking systems (ATS).
  - **Keep It Simple:** Avoid adding unnecessary details like version numbers (e.g., `Resume_v2.pdf`) or generic names (e.g., `MyResume.pdf`).

    Dear Hiring Manager,
    
    I am writing to express my interest in the Software Development Engineer (SDE) position at [Company Name]. With three years of experience at ClearTrail Technologies Pvt. Ltd., specializing in API design, third-party database integrations, and end-to-end software development, I am confident that my skills and experience align well with the requirements of this role.
    
    During my time at ClearTrail, I successfully led the development of SnapShot-K.1, a cybersecurity platform deployed in air-gapped environments, where I was responsible for managing backend services, integrating third-party databases, and developing scalable microservices. I also played a key role in enhancing data retrieval systems by optimizing PostgreSQL queries, reducing query times by 30%, and implementing a CIDR-based IP geo lookup mechanism that significantly improved the efficiency of our on-device IP reputation database.
    
    I take great pride in my ability to produce high-quality code. In fact, I have maintained a zero-defect status in Static Code Analysis, ensuring that my contributions meet industry standards for reliability and security. Additionally, I have streamlined our development processes by implementing automated CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and Docker, reducing deployment time by 40%. By leveraging Swagger UI for API documentation and adopting Markdown standards, I also ensured that our team's work was well-documented and easily accessible.
    
    I am particularly excited about the opportunity to bring my experience in developing scalable and innovative solutions to [Company Name]. I am drawn to the company's mission and am eager to contribute to its continued success. I believe that my technical expertise, collaborative mindset, and passion for software development will make me a valuable addition to your team.
    
    Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to [Company Name]'s goals. Please find my resume attached for your reference.
    
    Sincerely,
    Vijay Raghuwanshi
