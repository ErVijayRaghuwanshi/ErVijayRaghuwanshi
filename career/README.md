  <summary><strong>Resume File Naming Guidelines</strong></summary>

  **1. Include Your Full Name**  
  Incorporate your first and last name to personalize the file. For example:
  - `John_Doe_Resume.pdf`
  - `Jane_Smith_CV.pdf`

  **2. Specify the Document Type**  
  Clearly indicate that the file is a resume or CV.

  **3. Add Job Title or Position (Optional)**  
  Including the job title you're applying for can make your resume stand out and show that it's tailored for a specific role. For instance:
  - `John_Doe_Marketing_Manager_Resume.pdf`
  - `Jane_Smith_Software_Engineer_CV.pdf`

  **4. Use Hyphens or Underscores**  
  Separate words with hyphens or underscores to enhance readability. Avoid using spaces or other special characters, as they might not be compatible with some applicant tracking systems.

  **5. Avoid Version Numbers and Generic Terms**  
  Refrain from using version numbers (e.g., `Resume_v2.pdf`) or generic file names like `Resume.pdf`. These can appear unprofessional and may confuse recruiters.

  **6. Keep It Concise**  
  Aim for a file name that is descriptive yet succinct, ideally around 24 characters, to ensure the entire name is visible to recruiters.

  **7. Use Appropriate File Formats**  
  Save your resume in formats that preserve formatting and are widely accepted, such as PDF or DOCX. This ensures compatibility with various systems and devices.
