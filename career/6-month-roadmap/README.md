Thanks for sharing that super detailed packed with valuable advice for anyone serious about landing a role at a big tech company like Google in 2025! Here's a quick summary and some actionable points based on the 6-month roadmap if you're looking to follow it or need a reference:

---

### **🔧 Month 1 – Foundation**

- **Learn basics of DSA:**
  - Arrays, Strings, Stacks, Queues
  - Time & space complexity (Big-O)
  - Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Counting)
  - Searching (Linear, Binary)
- **Platform:** LeetCode (easy-tagged problems)

---

### **📚 Month 2 – Intermediate DSA + Intro to AI**
- **DSA Topics:**
  - Linked Lists, Trees, BSTs
  - Graphs (representation & traversal basics)
  - Recursion & backtracking
- **AI/ML Basics:**
  - Supervised & unsupervised learning
  - Linear/logistic regression, decision trees
  - Intro to neural networks
- **Continue LeetCode (start tackling medium-level problems)**

---

### **📊 Month 3 – Advanced DSA + Brainstorm Projects**
- **DSA Topics:**
  - Advanced graphs (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Kruskal, DSU)
  - Start dynamic programming (basic memoization)
- **System Design (basic concepts):**
  - Scalability, load balancing, caching, databases
- **AI:** Continue fundamentals
- **Start brainstorming project ideas** (AI-focused ideally)

---

### **🛠️ Month 4 – Build Projects + System Design Deep Dive**
- **DSA:** Advanced DP (grid-based, bitmasking)
- **System Design (deep dive for experienced folks):**
  - SQL vs NoSQL, queues, caching strategies
  - Design systems (e.g., social feed, recommendation engine)
- **Start building projects:**
  - Focus on functionality, not flashy UI
  - GitHub + deployment basics
- **Start doing LeetCode contests (optional)**

---

### **🎯 Month 5 – Mock Interviews + Project Completion + Job Search**
- **Practice:** 
  - Mock interviews (DSA/system design)
  - Company-specific LeetCode questions
- **Projects:**
  - Finalize, polish, write proper README
  - Host and deploy projects
- **Professional Prep:**
  - LinkedIn + GitHub profile setup
  - Resume writing (ATS-friendly)
  - Start reaching out to recruiters, join events

---

### **🚀 Month 6 – Full-On Job Search**
- **Refine everything:**
  - Resume, LinkedIn, GitHub
- **Job Applications:**
  - Don’t fixate on just FAANG—apply broadly
  - Ask for referrals
- **Keep practicing:** DSA, system design, mock interviews
- **Attend events/hackathons for visibility**

---

### ✅ Final Tips:
- Focus > Quantity: Better to do 2–3 projects well than many half-baked ones.
- Don’t wait for perfection—start applying as you build.
- Mock interviews will ease real interview anxiety.
- LeetCode Premium is optional. LintCode or other resources can help too.
