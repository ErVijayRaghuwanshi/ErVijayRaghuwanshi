Additional Skills to Learn

For Data Engineer

1. SQL & NoSQL Databases – Master databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis. Understand indexing, partitioning, and query optimization.


2. Big Data Technologies – Learn Apache Spark, Hadoop, and Kafka for handling large-scale data processing.


3. Cloud Platforms – Gain experience with AWS (Redshift, S3, Lambda), GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow), and Azure.


4. ETL & Data Pipelines – Learn Airflow, dbt, and Luigi to automate data workflows.


5. Data Warehousing – Understand how to build and optimize data lakes and warehouses.


6. Streaming Data Processing – Learn real-time data streaming with Apache Flink and Kafka Streams.


7. Data Governance & Security – Ensure compliance with GDPR, encryption, and access controls.



For Backend Developer

1. Advanced API Development – Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs efficiently.


2. Microservices & Distributed Systems – Understand gRPC, service discovery, and load balancing.


3. Caching & Performance Optimization – Use Redis, Memcached, and CDN caching techniques.


4. Containerization & Orchestration – Learn Docker, Kubernetes, and serverless architectures.


5. Testing & CI/CD – Implement automated testing (pytest, JUnit) and CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins/GitHub Actions.


6. Authentication & Security – Understand JWT, OAuth, and API gateway security best practices.
