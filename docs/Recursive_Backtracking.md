Here's a list of 25 recursion and backtracking problems, carefully curated from easy to medium difficulty. This progression is designed to help you gradually build your understanding and comfort with these powerful concepts.

For each problem, I'll briefly explain the core idea that links it to recursion or backtracking.

**Before you start:**

* **Understand the Call Stack:** Recursion heavily relies on the call stack. Visualize how function calls are pushed and popped.
* **Base Case:** Every recursive function needs one or more base cases to stop the recursion and prevent infinite loops.
* **Recursive Step:** How does the function call itself with a smaller or simpler version of the problem?
* **Backtracking:** When you make a choice, explore the path. When you return from the recursive call (backtrack), undo that choice so you can explore other paths. This "undoing" is crucial.

Let's get started!

### Easy Recursion Problems (Focus on basics)

1.  **Factorial:**
    * `n! = n * (n-1)!`
    * Base Case: `0! = 1` or `1! = 1`
    * **Concept:** Direct translation of mathematical definition to recursion.
2.  **Fibonacci Sequence:**
    * `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
    * Base Cases: `F(0) = 0`, `F(1) = 1`
    * **Concept:** Multiple recursive calls, common beginner problem.
3.  **Sum of Array Elements:**
    * Sum of `[a1, a2, ..., an]` is `a1 + Sum([a2, ..., an])`
    * Base Case: Sum of empty array is 0.
    * **Concept:** Processing elements one by one.
4.  **Reverse a String:**
    * Reverse of "abc" is "c" + reverse of "ab"
    * Base Case: Reverse of empty string or single-character string is itself.
    * **Concept:** Manipulating parts of a sequence.
5.  **Power (x^n):**
    * `x^n = x * x^(n-1)`
    * Base Case: `x^0 = 1`
    * **Concept:** Simple mathematical recursion.
6.  **Print N to 1 and 1 to N (separately):**
    * **Concept:** Demonstrates how print statements before/after recursive calls affect output order.
7.  **Check Palindrome (String):**
    * A string is a palindrome if its first and last characters match, and the substring between them is also a palindrome.
    * **Concept:** Shrinking the problem from both ends.
8.  **Count Digits in a Number:**
    * Number of digits in `N` is 1 + number of digits in `N/10`.
    * Base Case: Number of digits in 0 is 0 (or 1 depending on definition for single-digit numbers).
    * **Concept:** Simple mathematical recursion.

### Medium Recursion / Easy Backtracking Problems (Introducing choices and exploration)

9.  **Generate Parentheses (LeetCode 22):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. At each step, you can either add an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`, but you need to ensure validity (e.g., `(` count >= `)` count, and `(` count <= N). When you place a `(` or `)`, you recurse. When you return, you "undo" that placement.
10. **Subsets (LeetCode 78):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. For each element in the input array, you have two choices: either include it in the current subset or not. Recursively explore both paths.
11. **Permutations (LeetCode 46):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. To generate permutations, pick an element from the remaining available elements, add it to the current permutation, and recurse. Before returning, remove it to backtrack and try other choices.
12. **Combinations (LeetCode 77):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. Similar to subsets, but you need to choose exactly `k` elements, and order doesn't matter. You iterate through choices, add to current combination, recurse, and backtrack.
13. **N-Queens (LeetCode 51 - conceptual introduction):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. Place queens one row at a time. For each column in the current row, try placing a queen. If it's safe (doesn't attack previous queens), recurse to the next row. If not, try the next column. If you can't place a queen in the current row, backtrack to the previous row. (Solving it fully might be a bit more challenging than easy-medium, but understanding the backtracking setup is key).
14. **Word Search (LeetCode 79):**
    * **Concept:** DFS (which is essentially recursive backtracking on a grid/graph). Start at a potential first letter. From there, try to move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to form the rest of the word. Keep track of visited cells to avoid cycles and redundant paths.
15. **Sudoku Solver (LeetCode 37 - conceptual introduction):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. Find an empty cell. Try placing digits 1-9. If a digit is valid, place it and recurse. If the recursive call returns `True` (meaning a solution was found), propagate `True`. If not, remove the digit (backtrack) and try the next one.
16. **Combination Sum (LeetCode 39):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. Given a set of candidates and a target, find all unique combinations where the candidate numbers sum to the target. Numbers can be reused. This is like a variation of subsets/combinations where you have a target sum.
17. **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number (LeetCode 17):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. Map digits to letters. Recursively build combinations. For each digit, iterate through its corresponding letters, append one, recurse, and then remove it (backtrack).
18. **Permutations II (LeetCode 47):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking with duplicates. Similar to permutations, but you need to handle duplicate numbers in the input array to avoid generating duplicate permutations in the output. This often involves sorting the input and skipping duplicate choices.
19. **Subset Sum Problem (Check if subset with given sum exists):**
    * **Concept:** Recursive choice. For each element, either include it in the sum or not.
20. **Rat in a Maze:**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking/DFS on a grid. Find a path from a start point to an end point in a maze. At each cell, try moving in all valid directions. If a path leads to a dead end, backtrack.
21. **Palindrome Partitioning (LeetCode 131):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking. Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`. At each step, try splitting the string at different points, check if the first part is a palindrome, and then recursively solve for the rest.
22. **Path Sum (LeetCode 112 - on Binary Trees):**
    * **Concept:** DFS/Recursion on trees. Check if there exists a root-to-leaf path such that summing up all the values along the path equals a target sum.
23. **Maximum Depth of Binary Tree (LeetCode 104):**
    * **Concept:** Simple recursion on trees. The max depth of a node is 1 + max(depth of left child, depth of right child).
24. **Flood Fill (LeetCode 733):**
    * **Concept:** DFS/Recursion on a grid. Given a starting pixel, change its color and the color of all adjacent (4-directionally connected) pixels of the same original color to a new color. Similar to Number of Islands but with color change.
25. **Target Sum (LeetCode 494):**
    * **Concept:** Backtracking/Recursion. Given an array of integers, you want to build expressions by adding `+` or `-` to each integer and concatenate them. Find the number of ways to assign symbols to make a target sum. For each number, you have two choices: `+` or `-`. Recursively explore both.

This is an excellent list to build your skills! Here's some advice on approaching these problems:

### General Tips for Recursion & Backtracking Problems:

1.  **Draw Recursion Trees:** Especially for problems like Fibonacci, Factorial, Subsets, Permutations. This helps visualize the calls, branches, and how results combine.
2.  **Identify the State:** What information do you need to pass to the next recursive call? (e.g., current index, current sum, current list of chosen elements, remaining choices).
3.  **Define the Base Case:** This is the condition that stops the recursion. What's the smallest, simplest version of the problem where you know the answer immediately?
4.  **Define the Recursive Step:** How do you break down the problem into smaller subproblems? How does the solution to the subproblems contribute to the solution of the main problem?
5.  **Backtracking's "Undo" Step:** For backtracking problems (where you're exploring multiple paths), when you return from a recursive call, you often need to "undo" the choice you just made. This allows other branches of the recursion tree to explore different possibilities. For example, if you add an element to a `current_list`, you `append()` it before the recursive call, and `pop()` it after the call returns.
6.  **Use Helper Functions:** Often, it's cleaner to have a main function that sets up the initial call, and a helper recursive function that does the actual work.
7.  **Memoization (for overlapping subproblems):** For some recursive problems (like Fibonacci, Subset Sum, Target Sum), you might notice that the same subproblems are computed multiple times. This indicates that Dynamic Programming (memoization or tabulation) can optimize the solution from exponential to polynomial time. While not strictly "backtracking," it's a critical optimization for certain recursive patterns.

### Recommended Progression:

**Phase 1: Pure Recursion (Easy)**
Start with 1-8. These help you get comfortable with the concept of a function calling itself, identifying base cases, and breaking down simple problems.

**Phase 2: Introducing Choices & Basic Backtracking (Medium-Easy)**
Move to 9-12. These are fundamental backtracking problems where you make a choice, recurse, and then undo the choice. `Generate Parentheses`, `Subsets`, `Permutations`, and `Combinations` are cornerstone problems for mastering backtracking.

**Phase 3: Backtracking on Grids/Trees & With Constraints (Medium)**
Tackle 13-25. These problems apply the backtracking concept to more complex data structures (grids, trees) and introduce additional constraints (e.g., no duplicates in permutations, target sum, valid Sudoku placement). `N-Queens` and `Sudoku Solver` are classic, powerful examples, but feel free to start with `Word Search` or `Flood Fill` for grid-based recursion.

Good luck! This list will give you a very solid foundation in recursion and backtracking. Take your time with each problem, trace the execution, and visualize the choices being made.
