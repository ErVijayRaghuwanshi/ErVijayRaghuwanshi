# Authentication System Documentation

## Overview

This documentation covers a simple user authentication system implemented in Python. The system includes methods for user registration and login, along with both unit and functional tests to verify the behavior of the system. The goal is to provide a clear reference on how the system is designed, how each component works, and how to run the tests.

---

## System Components

### AuthSystem Class

The `AuthSystem` class is the core component of the authentication system. It maintains user data in a dictionary (`self.users`) where keys are usernames and values are passwords.

#### Methods

- **`__init__(self)`**  
  Initializes the authentication system with an empty dictionary for storing user credentials.
  
- **`register(self, username, password)`**  
  Registers a new user.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `username` (str): The unique identifier for the user.
    - `password` (str): The password for the user.
  - **Returns:**  
    - `"Registration successful"` if the user is new.
    - `"User already exists"` if the username is already registered.
    
- **`login(self, username, password)`**  
  Validates user login credentials.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `username` (str): The username to look up.
    - `password` (str): The password to verify.
  - **Returns:**  
    - `"Login successful"` if the username exists and the password matches.
    - `"User not found"` if the username does not exist.
    - `"Invalid credentials"` if the password does not match the stored one.

---

## Testing Overview

To ensure the system works correctly, two testing strategies are implemented:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are designed to verify the behavior of individual methods within the `AuthSystem` class. They use the Python `unittest` framework, focusing on isolated testing of:

- **New user registration:** Ensuring that a new user is added and recognized.
- **Duplicate registration:** Preventing registration of an existing user.
- **Successful login:** Confirming that valid credentials return a successful login response.
- **Wrong password login:** Handling cases where the password provided does not match.
- **Non-existent user login:** Handling login requests for users that were never registered.

#### Example Unit Test Code

```python
import unittest

class TestAuthSystemUnit(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.auth = AuthSystem()  # Create a fresh instance before each test

    def test_register_new_user(self):
        result = self.auth.register("user1", "password123")
        self.assertEqual(result, "Registration successful")
        self.assertIn("user1", self.auth.users)

    def test_register_existing_user(self):
        self.auth.register("user1", "password123")
        result = self.auth.register("user1", "newpassword456")
        self.assertEqual(result, "User already exists")

    def test_login_success(self):
        self.auth.register("user1", "password123")
        result = self.auth.login("user1", "password123")
        self.assertEqual(result, "Login successful")

    def test_login_wrong_password(self):
        self.auth.register("user1", "password123")
        result = self.auth.login("user1", "wrongpassword")
        self.assertEqual(result, "Invalid credentials")

    def test_login_user_not_found(self):
        result = self.auth.login("nonexistent_user", "password")
        self.assertEqual(result, "User not found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Functional Tests

Functional tests evaluate the system as a whole by simulating the complete user journey. These tests are less granular than unit tests and focus on the sequential flow of operations:

1. **Registration of a new user.**
2. **Duplicate registration attempt.**
3. **Successful login with correct credentials.**
4. **Unsuccessful login with an incorrect password.**
5. **Login attempt for a non-existent user.**

#### Example Functional Test Code

```python
def test_auth_system_functional():
    auth = AuthSystem()

    # Step 1: Register a user.
    register_response = auth.register("test_user", "securepassword")
    assert register_response == "Registration successful"

    # Step 2: Attempt to register the same user again.
    duplicate_register_response = auth.register("test_user", "newpassword")
    assert duplicate_register_response == "User already exists"

    # Step 3: Attempt to log in with the correct password.
    login_success_response = auth.login("test_user", "securepassword")
    assert login_success_response == "Login successful"

    # Step 4: Attempt to log in with the wrong password.
    login_failure_response = auth.login("test_user", "wrongpassword")
    assert login_failure_response == "Invalid credentials"

    # Step 5: Attempt to log in with a non-existent user.
    non_existent_user_response = auth.login("nonexistent_user", "password")
    assert non_existent_user_response == "User not found"

# Run functional tests manually
test_auth_system_functional()
```

---

## Running the Tests

### Unit Tests

To run the unit tests, use the `unittest` module from the command line:

```bash
python -m unittest your_test_file.py
```

Alternatively, many integrated development environments (IDEs) such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code support running unit tests directly from the interface.

### Functional Tests

Functional tests can be executed by simply running the Python script containing the `test_auth_system_functional` function. This test function is designed to run sequentially when the script is executed:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

Ensure that the functional test function (`test_auth_system_functional()`) is called in the global scope or within a conditional block like `if __name__ == "__main__":` to run properly.

---

## Future Enhancements

This simple authentication system and its test suite are foundational. Future enhancements might include:

- **Persistent Storage:** Integrate a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) instead of using an in-memory dictionary.
- **Security Improvements:** Implement password hashing (using libraries like `bcrypt`) to securely store passwords.
- **Error Handling:** Enhance error detection and handling throughout the system.
- **Extended Features:** Add functionality for account recovery, email verification, or multi-factor authentication.
- **Advanced Testing:** Incorporate integration testing and use more sophisticated testing frameworks for continuous integration.

---

## Code Structure and Conventions

- **Coding Style:**  
  The code follows Pythonâ€™s standard conventions, with clear function definitions, meaningful names, and inline comments for clarity.
- **Testing Approach:**  
  Unit tests are handled with the `unittest` framework, while functional tests are written as independent functions to simulate complete workflows.
- **Documentation:**  
  Detailed documentation ensures that both the system and the tests are understandable and maintainable for future development efforts.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive reference for the `AuthSystem` class and its testing strategy. The detailed code explanations, test procedures, and future enhancements should serve as a valuable resource for developers who maintain or extend this system. Regularly updating this documentation as the system evolves will help ensure ongoing clarity and efficiency in development practices.

Use this documentation as a blueprint for both understanding and extending the authentication system in the future.
